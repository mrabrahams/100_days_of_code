Instructions

You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5

                           = 1.6

But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.

IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
Example Input

test_h = 3
test_w = 9

Example Output

You'll need 6 cans of paint.

Hint

1. To round up a number:

2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.
